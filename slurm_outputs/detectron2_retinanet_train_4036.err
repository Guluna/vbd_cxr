Skip loading parameter 'head.cls_score.weight' to the model due to incompatible shapes: (720, 256, 3, 3) in the checkpoint but (630, 256, 3, 3) in the model! You might want to double check if this is expected.
Skip loading parameter 'head.cls_score.bias' to the model due to incompatible shapes: (720,) in the checkpoint but (630,) in the model! You might want to double check if this is expected.
Skip loading parameter 'head.bbox_pred.weight' to the model due to incompatible shapes: (36, 256, 3, 3) in the checkpoint but (180, 256, 3, 3) in the model! You might want to double check if this is expected.

Skip loading parameter 'anchor_generator.cell_anchors.0' to the model due to incompatible shapes: (9, 4) in the checkpoint but (45, 4) in the model! You might want to double check if this is expected.
